            I worked as an undergraduate researcher in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at MIT.

            Relevant areas:
            <ul>
                <li>Prototyping in XPlane 11</li>
                <li>MATLAB Scripting</li>
                <li>Git Version Control</li>
                <li><a href="https://Electra.aero">Electra</a> - electric short takeoff and landing vehicle (eSTOL) urban air mobility technology</li>
            </ul>
            What is my role? 

            â†’ I applied my aeronautical knowledge and experience to designing the cockpit for an entirely new and experimental aircraft. Due to the blown lift aerodynamics of the electra eSTOL vehicle, the approach and departure paths are significantly steeper than a traditional aircraft. I worked with a team of PhDs and MIT faculty to propose the visual elements, instrumentation/avionics layout, and UI design in the simulator before the technical demonstrator is built for real-world testing.

            I have a passion for the urban mobility sector and I am fascinated by the idea of electric air taxis replacing inefficient modes of transportation today.
